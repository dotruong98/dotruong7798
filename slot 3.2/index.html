<p2 style="color: white;"> Shaking his head, he just woke up after falling into a coma, Luc Thieu Du felt that his surroundings were very wet, and his whole body ached as if he was going to be paralyzed. The wind blew from all around, hitting him, making him feel numb. I couldn't help but shiver.

    Luc Thieu Du's head broke out in cold sweat, he quickly opened his eyes. The surrounding space was just pitch black, in the air, a crescent moon was hanging. After a while, using the weak light emitted from the moon, he could see the scene a little more clearly. He is currently in a lagoon, it must be night time. </p2>
